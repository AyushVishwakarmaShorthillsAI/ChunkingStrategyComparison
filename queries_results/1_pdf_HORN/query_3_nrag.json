The homozygous c.599+1G>A mutation is frequently observed among the novel patients (Patients 2, 3, 4, 5). Epilepsy was noted in two of the five novel patients (Patient 1 and 2, both with GTCS) and in 33% of literature cases, with seizure onset ranging from infancy to early childhood. While Patient 3's MRI was normal, other novel patients and 50% of literature cases showed various brain abnormalities, highlighting a spectrum of neurological involvement. **6.

Key Findings:**\nA significant and consistent finding across all five novel patients and 100% of previously reported cases in the literature is the presence of developmental delay or intellectual disability. Macrocephaly at the last evaluation was universally reported in 100% of literature cases. Dysmorphic facial features, particularly frontal bossing (present in Patient 1, Patient 2, and 100% of literature cases) and prominent chin (present in Patient 3 and 73% of literature cases), are common manifestations of *KPTN* gene-related syndrome.

Table Purpose:**\nThis table presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epilepsy characteristics, for five newly identified patients with *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. It also aggregates and compares these findings with data from 15 previously reported patients in existing literature to provide broader context and identify common patterns. **3. Table Structure:**\nThe table is organized into columns representing individual patients (Patient 1 through Patient 5) and a summary column for \"Data in literature\" comprising 15 previously reported cases. The rows are categorized into three main sections: general patient information, \"Anthropometric data,\" and \"Neurodevelopmental phenotype and epilepsy.\"",

So far, severe developmental delay and primary, or more frequently secondary, macrocephaly (with a range up to + 5.4 SD) have been reported as the consistent features in 14/14 published affected individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN (5). Our data with the lack of macrocephaly in one patient indicate that macrocephaly does not occur in all patients with this syndrome. Epilepsy has been reported to occur in one-third of affected individuals, varying with respect to seizure types and severity (5). GTCSs are the most frequently described seizure type, starting between 3 months and 7 years of age (5).",

Here, we report novel MRI findings of optic nerve tortuosity and signs of intracranial hypertension in patients 1 and 2 (flattened pituitary gland in patient 1 and mild enlargement of the inner cerebrospinal fluid spaces in patient 2). Intracranial hypertension, in patient 2 confirmed by lumbar puncture and to a mild degree in patient 1, has not previously been reported in association with pathogenic biallelic variants of KPTN. More than half of the reported patients developed behavioral abnormalities such as repetitive speech, stereotypic movements, hyperactivity, and autistic features (1, 5). Patients 1, 2, and 3 of this study presented similar behavioral problems.",
