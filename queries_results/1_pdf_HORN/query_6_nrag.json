Specifically, Patient 3 had an IQ of 30–50, while Patient 4 and Patient 5 each had an IQ of 50–70. All 100% of the literature cases also showed developmental delay or intellectual disability. In terms of behavioral abnormalities, Patient 1 exhibited repetitive movements, autistic features, and stereotypic movements. Patient 2 displayed stereotypic movements, and Patient 3 had general behavioral abnormalities. Behavioral abnormalities were not documented for Patient 4 and Patient 5. In the literature, 33% of patients had behavioral abnormalities. Epilepsy was present in Patient 1, characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), and in Patient 2, also with GTCS. Patient 3, Patient 4, and Patient 5 did not experience epilepsy. Among the literature cases, 33% had epilepsy, with 3 cases presenting with GTCS and 2 cases presenting with absence seizures (AS) or GTCS.",

GTCSs are the most frequently described seizure type, starting between 3 months and 7 years of age (5). Detailed data of ASM of these reported individuals have not yet been published. Here, we report epilepsy in two of five patients. Patients 1 and 2 of this study have developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) with an early diagnosis of a developmental delay and seizure onset at the age of 5 years and 13 months, respectively. The other three patients had not developed epilepsy at the age of 6, 9, and 13 years, respectively. They hold a developmental delay phenotype. So far, only one patient with MRT41 carrying the compound heterozygous variants p.(Met241_Gln246dup) and c.394 + 1G > A was reported with intractable epilepsy and had died at the age of 9 years due to SE (3). Structural brain anomalies may be part of the phenotypic spectrum.",

Patient 4 was a 9year-old boy with psychomotor delay and moderate intellectual disability with an IQ of 50-70 (Table 1). The expressive language was particularly affected. Physical examination at the age of 9 years showed a height of 128 cm ( -1.4 SD), a weight of 30 kg ( -0.1 SD), and no facial abnormalities. Hearing tests gave normal results. Patient 5 was a 6-year-old boy who also showed moderate intellectual disability, especially with difficulties in expressive language. A hearing problem was excluded in this patient. A genetic investigation confirmed the presence of the homozygous variant c.599 + 1G > A in KPTN in both brothers (Figure 3). Neither of them had seizures. The parents were both heterozygous carriers of the pathogenic KPTN c.599 + 1G > A variant and the GJB2 c.35delG variant, respectively.",
