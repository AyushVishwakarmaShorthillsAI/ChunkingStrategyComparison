Patient 2 displayed stereotypic movements, and Patient 3 had general behavioral abnormalities. Behavioral abnormalities were not documented for Patient 4 and Patient 5. In the literature, 33% of patients had behavioral abnormalities. Epilepsy was present in Patient 1, characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), and in Patient 2, also with GTCS. Patient 3, Patient 4, and Patient 5 did not experience epilepsy. Among the literature cases, 33% had epilepsy, with 3 cases presenting with GTCS and 2 cases presenting with absence seizures (AS) or GTCS.",

EEG findings for Patient 1 included epileptic discharges and focal slow activity in the frontal region. Patient 2's EEG showed fronto-temporal sharp-wave complexes on the left side. EEG findings were not documented for Patient 3, Patient 4, and Patient 5, and were not available for the literature data. MRI findings for Patient 1 revealed optical nerve tortuosity and a flat pituitary gland. Patient 2's MRI indicated a mild enlargement of the inner cerebrospinal fluid spaces.

Table Purpose:**\nThis table presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epilepsy characteristics, for five newly identified patients with *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. It also aggregates and compares these findings with data from 15 previously reported patients in existing literature to provide broader context and identify common patterns. **3. Table Structure:**\nThe table is organized into columns representing individual patients (Patient 1 through Patient 5) and a summary column for \"Data in literature\" comprising 15 previously reported cases. The rows are categorized into three main sections: general patient information, \"Anthropometric data,\" and \"Neurodevelopmental phenotype and epilepsy.\"",
