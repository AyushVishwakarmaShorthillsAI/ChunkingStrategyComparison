Table Title/Caption:**\nThe table is titled \"TABLE 1 Comparison of clinical manifestations of KPTN gene-related syndrome in five novel patients with previously reported patients.\" **2. Table Purpose:**\nThis table presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epilepsy characteristics, for five newly identified patients with *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. It also aggregates and compares these findings with data from 15 previously reported patients in existing literature to provide broader context and identify common patterns. **3. Table Structure:**\nThe table is organized into columns representing individual patients (Patient 1 through Patient 5) and a summary column for \"Data in literature\" comprising 15 previously reported cases. The rows are categorized into three main sections: general patient information, \"Anthropometric data,\" and \"Neurodevelopmental phenotype and epilepsy.\"",

Patient 3's MRI was normal, while MRI findings were not documented for Patient 4 and Patient 5. In the literature, 50% of patients presented with different brain abnormalities. **5. Key Findings:**\nA significant and consistent finding across all five novel patients and 100% of previously reported cases in the literature is the presence of developmental delay or intellectual disability. Macrocephaly at the last evaluation was universally reported in 100% of literature cases. Dysmorphic facial features, particularly frontal bossing (present in Patient 1, Patient 2, and 100% of literature cases) and prominent chin (present in Patient 3 and 73% of literature cases), are common manifestations of *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. The homozygous c.599+1G>A mutation is frequently observed among the novel patients (Patients 2, 3, 4, 5).",

Epilepsy was noted in two of the five novel patients (Patient 1 and 2, both with GTCS) and in 33% of literature cases, with seizure onset ranging from infancy to early childhood. While Patient 3's MRI was normal, other novel patients and 50% of literature cases showed various brain abnormalities, highlighting a spectrum of neurological involvement. **6.

So far, severe developmental delay and primary, or more frequently secondary, macrocephaly (with a range up to + 5.4 SD) have been reported as the consistent features in 14/14 published affected individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN (5). Our data with the lack of macrocephaly in one patient indicate that macrocephaly does not occur in all patients with this syndrome. Epilepsy has been reported to occur in one-third of affected individuals, varying with respect to seizure types and severity (5). GTCSs are the most frequently described seizure type, starting between 3 months and 7 years of age (5).",
