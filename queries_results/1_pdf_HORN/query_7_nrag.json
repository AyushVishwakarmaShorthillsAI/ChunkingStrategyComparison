So far, severe developmental delay and primary, or more frequently secondary, macrocephaly (with a range up to + 5.4 SD) have been reported as the consistent features in 14/14 published affected individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN (5). Our data with the lack of macrocephaly in one patient indicate that macrocephaly does not occur in all patients with this syndrome. Epilepsy has been reported to occur in one-third of affected individuals, varying with respect to seizure types and severity (5). GTCSs are the most frequently described seizure type, starting between 3 months and 7 years of age (5).",

Table Purpose:**\nThis table presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epilepsy characteristics, for five newly identified patients with *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. It also aggregates and compares these findings with data from 15 previously reported patients in existing literature to provide broader context and identify common patterns. **3. Table Structure:**\nThe table is organized into columns representing individual patients (Patient 1 through Patient 5) and a summary column for \"Data in literature\" comprising 15 previously reported cases. The rows are categorized into three main sections: general patient information, \"Anthropometric data,\" and \"Neurodevelopmental phenotype and epilepsy.\"",

MRT41 is characterized by developmental delay, predominantly in language development, behavioral abnormalities, and epilepsy. Only about 15 affected individuals have been described in the literature, all with primary or secondary macrocephaly. Using exome sequencing, we identified three different biallelic variants in KPTN in five affected individuals from three unrelated families. In total, two KPTN variants were already reported as a loss of function variants. A novel splice site variant in KPTN was detected in two unrelated families of this study. The core phenotype with neurodevelopment delay was present in all patients. However, macrocephaly was not present in at least one patient.",

Key Findings:**\nA significant and consistent finding across all five novel patients and 100% of previously reported cases in the literature is the presence of developmental delay or intellectual disability. Macrocephaly at the last evaluation was universally reported in 100% of literature cases. Dysmorphic facial features, particularly frontal bossing (present in Patient 1, Patient 2, and 100% of literature cases) and prominent chin (present in Patient 3 and 73% of literature cases), are common manifestations of *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. The homozygous c.599+1G>A mutation is frequently observed among the novel patients (Patients 2, 3, 4, 5).",
