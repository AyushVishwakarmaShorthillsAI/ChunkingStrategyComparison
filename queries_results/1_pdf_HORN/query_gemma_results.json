Patient 3's MRI was normal, while MRI findings were not documented for Patient 4 and Patient 5. In the literature, 50% of patients presented with different brain abnormalities. **5. Key Findings:**\nA significant and consistent finding across all five novel patients and 100% of previously reported cases in the literature is the presence of developmental delay or intellectual disability. Macrocephaly at the last evaluation was universally reported in 100% of literature cases. Dysmorphic facial features, particularly frontal bossing (present in Patient 1, Patient 2, and 100% of literature cases) and prominent chin (present in Patient 3 and 73% of literature cases), are common manifestations of *KPTN* gene-related syndrome. The homozygous c.599+1G>A mutation is frequently observed among the novel patients (Patients 2, 3, 4, 5).",

So far, severe developmental delay and primary, or more frequently secondary, macrocephaly (with a range up to + 5.4 SD) have been reported as the consistent features in 14/14 published affected individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN (5). Our data with the lack of macrocephaly in one patient indicate that macrocephaly does not occur in all patients with this syndrome. Epilepsy has been reported to occur in one-third of affected individuals, varying with respect to seizure types and severity (5). GTCSs are the most frequently described seizure type, starting between 3 months and 7 years of age (5).",
