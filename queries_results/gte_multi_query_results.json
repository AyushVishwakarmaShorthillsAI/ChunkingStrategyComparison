While some features like hypotonia, anxiety, and stereotyped behaviors are also frequently observed, there is notable variability in other phenotypes, such as hooded eyelids, broad nasal tip, fifth finger clinodactyly, self-aggression, precocious puberty, and hypoglycemia, which were often unique to one or two reports. This suggests a broad phenotypic spectrum for *KPTN* gene variations, with some core features and other more variable manifestations. Different *KPTN* variants are associated with these diverse phenotypic presentations. **6.",
