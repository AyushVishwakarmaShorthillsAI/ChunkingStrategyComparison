All\n these findings suggest that a variable phenotypic spectrum should be\n expected in patients with KPTN alterations, and that seizures (33%),\n behavioral problems (80%), craniosynostosis (33%), and brain changes\n in MRI (50%) might be not fully penetrant features of this condition.\n However, the actual prevalence and significance of these features\n require further research.

Language development is highly variable and ranges from normal speech development\n to nonverbal $(8/54$ individuals were nonverbal); speech delay is observed in 93% $(50/54)$.\n\nMovement coordination abnormalities include balance problems and oral apraxia, which may lead to infant\n feeding difficulties.\n\nIntellectual disability (ID) is seen in all affected individuals to date, although severity is highly variable, from\n mild to profound. Overall severity of ID, as reported by treating clinicians, is as follows: mild ID in\n approximately 30% $(14/47)$ of affected individuals, moderate ID in 53% $(25/47)$, severe ID in 15% $(7/47),$ and\n profound ID in 2% $(1/47)$. Generally, the severity of ID is related to the presence and control of seizures.\n Detailed psychometric tests were carried out in six Amish individuals and identified a moderate level of ID with\n impairment in all cognitive domains, except relative sparing of narrative memory function [Levitin et al 2023].\n Dyslexia and dysgraphia have been reported in affected individuals.\n\nNeurobehavioral/psychiatric manifestations are a common but variable feature. Anxiety was reported in 57%\n $(25/44)$ of affected individuals, including panic attacks and phobias. Stereotypies were reported in 52% $(24/46)$ of\n individuals, including hand flapping/clapping/rubbing, picking, head banging, and rocking. Impaired social\n interactions were reported in 50% $(24/48)$ of individuals, hyperactivity in 31% $(14/45)$, repetitive speech in 28%\n $(11/39)$ and a single individual had a tic disorder.\n\nMacrocephaly. An occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) more than two standard deviations (SD) above the\n mean was identified in 49% $(23/47)$ of individuals with KPTN-related disorder, although 96% $(45/47)$ had a\n larger-than-average OFC. OFC range is between 0.44 SD below the mean and 6.11 SD above the mean.\n Macrocephaly develops postnatally, within the first year of life. Data on birth OFC was available for $22/54$\n individuals; of these, only one individual was",
