These are in addition to macrocephaly, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Distinguishing features of Fragile X syndrome from KPTN-related disorder include macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse. **Key Findings**:\nBoth CHD8-related neurodevelopmental disorder and Fragile X syndrome share common neurological features with KPTN-related disorder, specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and seizures. However, their modes of inheritance differ, with CHD8-related disorder being autosomal dominant and Fragile X syndrome being X-linked. Distinctive characteristics aid in their differential diagnosis: CHD8-related disorder presents with specific gastrointestinal issues and developmental regression, while Fragile X syndrome is uniquely associated with macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse.",

The term \"overgrowth\" in the name of the CHD8-related disorder suggests another key phenotypic difference that may or may not be present in KPTN-related disorder. **Context**:\nThe table specifies that the overlapping features are \"in addition to macrocephaly & ID/DD,\" indicating that macrocephaly, intellectual disability, and developmental delay are common across all these conditions and are therefore not used for distinguishing them. A footnote for \"Fragile X syndrome\" refers the reader to \"FMR1 Disorders,\" suggesting that more comprehensive information about this condition is available elsewhere.",

Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (OMIM 616638), which is inherited in an Autosomal Dominant (AD) manner, exhibits several overlapping features with KPTN-related disorders. These include facial features such as frontal bossing, hypertelorism, and downslanted palpebral fissures, along with hypotonia, seizures, and behavioral issues. A key distinguishing feature for Smith-Kingsmore syndrome is the presence of skin pigmentary abnormalities.

Hypotonic facies are identified as a distinguishing feature for this disorder. Two disorders are associated with the PTEN gene, both inherited in an Autosomal Dominant (AD) manner.
