These are in addition to macrocephaly, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Distinguishing features of Fragile X syndrome from KPTN-related disorder include macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse. **Key Findings**:\nBoth CHD8-related neurodevelopmental disorder and Fragile X syndrome share common neurological features with KPTN-related disorder, specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and seizures. However, their modes of inheritance differ, with CHD8-related disorder being autosomal dominant and Fragile X syndrome being X-linked. Distinctive characteristics aid in their differential diagnosis: CHD8-related disorder presents with specific gastrointestinal issues and developmental regression, while Fragile X syndrome is uniquely associated with macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse.",

Features that distinguish CHD8-related neurodevelopmental disorder from KPTN-related disorder include gastrointestinal issues, such as recurrent constipation which may include periods of diarrhea, and developmental regression of social, speech, and/or motor skills observed during infancy and early childhood. Regarding the FMR1 gene, the associated disorder is Fragile X syndrome, which has an X-linked (XL) mode of inheritance. Fragile X syndrome shares several features with KPTN-related disorder, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), behavioral issues like hyperactivity, frontal bossing, a prominent jaw, and seizures.

Many disorders share common overlapping features with KPTN-related conditions, particularly facial features like frontal bossing and downslanted palpebral fissures, hypotonia, seizures, and ventriculomegaly. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is also a frequently recurring overlapping feature, observed in PPP2R5D, both PTEN-related conditions, and SETD2-related disorder. The presence of specific distinguishing features is crucial for accurate diagnosis, such as skin pigmentary abnormalities for Smith-Kingsmore syndrome, generalized overgrowth for Sotos syndrome, and cancer predisposition for PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome.",

Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (OMIM 616638), which is inherited in an Autosomal Dominant (AD) manner, exhibits several overlapping features with KPTN-related disorders. These include facial features such as frontal bossing, hypertelorism, and downslanted palpebral fissures, along with hypotonia, seizures, and behavioral issues. A key distinguishing feature for Smith-Kingsmore syndrome is the presence of skin pigmentary abnormalities. Next, Sotos syndrome, linked to the NSD1 gene and also inherited in an Autosomal Dominant (AD) fashion, shares multiple overlapping characteristics with KPTN-related disorders.",
