These are in addition to macrocephaly, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Distinguishing features of Fragile X syndrome from KPTN-related disorder include macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse. **Key Findings**:\nBoth CHD8-related neurodevelopmental disorder and Fragile X syndrome share common neurological features with KPTN-related disorder, specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and seizures. However, their modes of inheritance differ, with CHD8-related disorder being autosomal dominant and Fragile X syndrome being X-linked. Distinctive characteristics aid in their differential diagnosis: CHD8-related disorder presents with specific gastrointestinal issues and developmental regression, while Fragile X syndrome is uniquely associated with macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse.",

While some features like hypotonia, anxiety, and stereotyped behaviors are also frequently observed, there is notable variability in other phenotypes, such as hooded eyelids, broad nasal tip, fifth finger clinodactyly, self-aggression, precocious puberty, and hypoglycemia, which were often unique to one or two reports. This suggests a broad phenotypic spectrum for *KPTN* gene variations, with some core features and other more variable manifestations. Different *KPTN* variants are associated with these diverse phenotypic presentations. **6.",
