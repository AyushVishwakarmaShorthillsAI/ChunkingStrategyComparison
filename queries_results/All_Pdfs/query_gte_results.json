Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (OMIM 616638), which is inherited in an Autosomal Dominant (AD) manner, exhibits several overlapping features with KPTN-related disorders. These include facial features such as frontal bossing, hypertelorism, and downslanted palpebral fissures, along with hypotonia, seizures, and behavioral issues. A key distinguishing feature for Smith-Kingsmore syndrome is the presence of skin pigmentary abnormalities. Next, Sotos syndrome, linked to the NSD1 gene and also inherited in an Autosomal Dominant (AD) fashion, shares multiple overlapping characteristics with KPTN-related disorders.",

However, their modes of inheritance differ, with CHD8-related disorder being autosomal dominant and Fragile X syndrome being X-linked. Distinctive characteristics aid in their differential diagnosis: CHD8-related disorder presents with specific gastrointestinal issues and developmental regression, while Fragile X syndrome is uniquely associated with macroorchidism and mitral valve prolapse.",

While some features like hypotonia, anxiety, and stereotyped behaviors are also frequently observed, there is notable variability in other phenotypes, such as hooded eyelids, broad nasal tip, fifth finger clinodactyly, self-aggression, precocious puberty, and hypoglycemia, which were often unique to one or two reports. This suggests a broad phenotypic spectrum for *KPTN* gene variations, with some core features and other more variable manifestations. Different *KPTN* variants are associated with these diverse phenotypic presentations. **6.",
