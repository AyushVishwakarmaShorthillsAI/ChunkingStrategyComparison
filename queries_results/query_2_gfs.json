Introduction\n\nBiallelic variants in KPTN cause the syndrome referred to as autosomal recessive\n intellectual developmental disorder 41 (MRT41, OMIM 615637) (1). MRT41 is\n characterized by developmental delay, predominantly in language development,\n behavioral abnormalities, and epilepsy. However, only few affected individuals have been\n\n01\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\n\nHorn et al\n\n10.3389/fneur. 2022.1113811\n\ndescribed so far. MRT41 was first identified in four\n consanguineous families of the Amish community of Ohio\n in 2014 (1). All affected individuals in this study presented\n with macrocephaly and neurodevelopmental delay, and one-\n third developed epilepsy with the absence of seizures and\n generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Using microsatellite-marker\n analysis followed by whole exome sequencing (WES), the\n homozygous truncating variant p.(Ser259 ) in the KPTN gene\n (NM_007059.4) was discovered in two families of this study (1).\n In the two other families of this study, the above-mentioned\n nonsense variant was detected in a compound heterozygous\n state with an in-frame duplication p.(Met241_246Glndup).\n This duplication of the six amino acids was predicted to disrupt\n the alpha-helix 4 of the protein. Functional studies of both\n variants suggested a loss of function effect (LoF) either by the\n degradation of the mutant transcript via nonsense-mediated\n mRNA decay (NMD) or by the production of mislocalized\n and/or non-functional protein products (1). This duplication\n together with the splice site variant $c.394+1G>A,$ and a\n frameshift variant (2) p. (Ser223fs), was described in two further\n affected families, respectively (2, 3). An additional recurrent\n homozygous frameshift variant p. (Ser200Ilefs) was reported\n in two unrelated families (4, 5). All these affected individuals\n presented with core manifestations, developmental delay, and\n macrocephaly (4, 5),\n\nThe KPTN gene encodes for kaptin, which plays a\n crucial role in the neuromorphogenesis and development of\n the brain. Kaptin was shown to be expressed in neuronal\n cells and was found to localize to F-actin-rich structures\n (1). Immunofluorescence analyses in primary neuronal cells\n demonstrated endogenous and GFP-tagged kaptin to be\n associated with dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures (1). The\n loss of kaptin function leads to an impairment of the neuronal\n actin cytoskeleton, dendritic arborization, and spine formation\n (1). Furthermore, kaptin has been proven as a negative upstream\n regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway as a part of\n the KICSTOR protein complex (6). mTORC1 is an important\n regulator of cell growth and is dysregulated in different human.\n diseases, including cancer and epilepsy phenotypes. Because\n of hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, patients with pathogenic\n variants in KPTN might benefit from mTORC inhibitors (5).\n\nDetailed data on seizures and antiepileptic treatment of\n individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN have not\n yet been published. We present the data of 5 novel patients with\n special emphasis on severe epilepsy and antiepileptic treatment\n in two of them.\n\n1.1. Clinical report\n\nPatient I was a 6-year-old son of non-consanguineous\n parents of German origin. He was born at term without\n complications after an uneventful pregnancy, with normal\n birth",

            "content": "with three\n different pathogenic KPTN variants (Table 1). So far, severe\n developmental delay and primary, or more frequently\n secondary, macrocephaly (with a range up to $+5.4$ SD) have\n been reported as the consistent features in $14/14$ published\n affected individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN\n (5). Our data with the lack of macrocephaly in one patient\n indicate that macrocephaly does not occur in all patients with\n this syndrome.\n\nEpilepsy has been reported to occur in one-third of affected\n individuals, varying with respect to seizure types and severity (5).\n GTCSs are the most frequently described seizure type, starting\n between 3 months and 7 years of age (5). Detailed data of ASM\n of these reported individuals have not yet been published. Here,\n we report epilepsy in two of five patients. Patients 1 and 2 of\n this study have developmental and epileptic encephalopathies\n (DEEs) with an early diagnosis of a developmental delay and\n seizure onset at the age of 5 years and 13 months, respectively.\n The other three patients had not developed epilepsy at the age of\n 6, 9, and 13 years, respectively. They hold a developmental delay\n phenotype. So far, only one patient with MRT41 carrying the\n compound heterozygous variants p.(Met241_Gln246dup) and\n c.394+1G>A was reported with intractable epilepsy and had\n died at the age of 9 years due to SE (3).\n\nStructural brain anomalies may be part of the phenotypic\n spectrum. Various brain anomalies such as ventriculomegaly\n and non-specific supratentorial leukoencephalopathy have been\n documented in half of the reported affected individuals, but\n none has been reported in several individuals frequently. Here,\n we report novel MRI findings of optic nerve tortuosity and\n signs of intracranial hypertension in patients 1 and 2 (flattened.\n pituitary gland in patient 1 and mild enlargement of the\n inner cerebrospinal fluid spaces in patient 2). Intracranial\n hypertension, in patient 2 confirmed by lumbar puncture and\n to a mild degree in patient 1, has not previously been reported in\n association with pathogenic biallelic variants of KPTN.\n\nMore than half of the reported patients developed behavioral\n abnormalities such as repetitive speech, stereotypic movements,\n hyperactivity, and autistic features (1, 5). Patients 1, 2, and 3\n of this study presented similar behavioral problems. Frontal\n bossing and prominent chin are the most frequently described\n facial anomalies in this condition, also present in patients 1\n and 2 (frontal bossing) and patient 3 (prominent chin) reported\n here (5).\n\nThe heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ser200llefs*55)\n found in patient 1 has been reported in two affected\n families of different populations (4, 5). The second variant,\n p.(Met241_Gln246dup), detected in patient 1 has been described\n in a compound heterozygous state in two other affected families\n and is shown to have a profound effect on kaptin function (1,3).\n This in-frame duplication in compound heterozygous status is\n associated with a wide range of severity from status epilepticus\n to absence seizures (1, 3). Comparing the data on all published\n patients, there is no association between a specific mutation\n in KPTN and the severity of epilepsy. The homozygous KPTN\n variant c.599+1G>A, affecting a splice site, occurred in the\n unrelated",

Her\n psychomotor development was markedly delayed from infancy\n (Table 1). At the age of 13 years, she had a severe intellectual\n disability with an IQ of 30-50 without speech development. She\n had behavior problems such as autistic features. In addition,\n she showed profound sensorineural hearing loss. At the age\n of 13 years, her height was 150 cm (-1.3 SD), and her weight\n was 40 kg (-1.1 SD). Her facial signs included a broad nasal\n bridge, a short philtrum, a large mouth, and a prominent\n chin. MRI of the brain showed no abnormalities. WES revealed\n the homozygous variant c.599+1G>Ain KPTN (Figure 3). In\n addition, the homozygous pathogenic variant c.35delG in GJB2,\n associated with hearing loss, was identified. Neither MRI nor\n EEG results have been available for evaluation.\n\nPatients 4 and 5 were her affected brothers. Both were born\n at 40 weeks of gestation with normal measurements and have\n no medical problems in the neonatal period. Patient 4 was a 9-\n year-old boy with psychomotor delay and moderate intellectual\n disability with an IQ of 50-70 (Table 1). The expressive language\n was particularly affected. Physical examination at the age of\n 9 years showed a height of 128 cm (-1.4 SD), a weight of\n $30~kg(-0.1~SD)$ and no facial abnormalities. Hearing tests gave\n normal results. Patient 5 was a 6-year-old boy who also showed\n moderate intellectual disability, especially with difficulties in\n expressive language. A hearing problem was excluded in this\n patient. A genetic investigation confirmed the presence of the\n homozygous variant c.599+1G>A in KPTN in both brothers\n (Figure 3). Neither of them had seizures. The parents were both\n heterozygous carriers of the pathogenic KPTN c.599+1G>A\n variant and the GJB2 c.35delG variant, respectively.\n\n2.
