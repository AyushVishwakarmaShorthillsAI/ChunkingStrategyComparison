The phenotypic profile is similar to the cases described in the other families. Presence of macrocephaly and delayed development indicate the possibility of KPTN gene variation. Genetic testing should be carried out at an early stage in order to reach a timely diagnosis. homozygous variant, intellectual disability, KPTN, macrocephaly shared the same homozygous region responsible for kaptin protein coding (19q.13.3) which led them to believe that the pathogenic role of alterations in this protein were caused by changes to KPTN .",

Using microsatellite-marker analysis followed by whole exome sequencing (WES), the homozygous truncating variant p.(Ser259 ∗ ) in the KPTN gene (NM_007059.4) was discovered in two families of this study (1). In the two other families of this study, the above-mentioned nonsense variant was detected in a compound heterozygous state with an in-frame duplication p.(Met241_246Glndup).

This duplication together with the splice site variant c.394 + 1G > A, and a frameshift variant (2) p.(Ser223fs), was described in two further affected families, respectively (2, 3). An additional recurrent homozygous frameshift variant p.(Ser200Ilefs ∗ ) was reported in two unrelated families (4, 5). All these affected individuals presented with core manifestations, developmental delay, and macrocephaly (4, 5).

Immunofluorescence analyses in primary neuronal cells demonstrated endogenous and GFP-tagged kaptin to be associated with dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures (1). The loss of kaptin function leads to an impairment of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton, dendritic arborization, and spine formation (1). Furthermore, kaptin has been proven as a negative upstream regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway as a part of the KICSTOR protein complex (6). mTORC1 is an important regulator of cell growth and is dysregulated in different human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy phenotypes. Because of hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, patients with pathogenic variants in KPTN might benefit from mTORC inhibitors (5).",

So far, 13 patients from families harboring either homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in KPTN have been reported (Baple et al., 2014; Lucena et al., 2020; Pajusalu et al., 2015; Thiffault et al., 2019). The kaptin protein encoded by the KPTN gene has been associated with neuronal actin cytoskeletal structures and is known to play a crucial role in the formation, propagation and migration of neuronal cells during brain development. Several cell culture analyses have shown that this association was altered when truncating variants in the KPTN gene were introduced, and a disruption in neuromorphogenesis was likely to occur (Baple et al., 2014).",

Besides frontal bossing, prominent chin is the only facial feature that stands out in this cohort, being present in 11 of the 15 cases. Four out of the 13 cases reported by Baple et al. (2014) had scaphocephaly secondary to premature closure of the sagittal suture. Interestingly, both siblings in the present report showed delayed anterior fontanel closure. The younger sister also showed brain anomalies, as did patient 5 reported by Baple et al. (2014) and two additional patients reported by Thiffault et al. (2020) and Lucena et al. (2020).",

Our two cases, however, do not show any of the behavioral problems previously associated with mutations in KPTN , such as anxiety or stereotypical behaviors. Neither do they have seizures, endocrine or metabolic disturbances. Behavioral alterations and seizures in patients with KPTN-related disease have been described from early childhood (Baple et al., 2014; Pajusalu et al., 2015; Thiffault et al., 2020; Lucena et al., 2020), but no information was provided regarding the age of onset of the metabolic or endocrine problems.

In summary, homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the KPTN gene may be a hitherto under-recognized cause of macrocephaly, of postnatal origin in some cases, developmental delay, intellectual disability and language deficit.

The mortality for convulsive status epilepticus is dependent on the underlying aetiologies and the age of the patients and thus varies from study to study. In this context, effective molecular diagnosis in a pediatric patient with a genetically heterogeneous phenotype is essential. Homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in KPTN have been recently associated with a syndrome typified by macrocephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, and seizures. We describe a comprehensive investigation of a 9-yr-old male patient who was admitted to the intensive care unit, with focal epilepsy, static encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorder, and macrocephaly of unknown etiology, who died of status epilepticus. Clinical whole-genome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants in the KPTN gene.",

As the cost of NGS falls, it has become feasible to use this powerful technology in clinical care, simultaneously unraveling variations in about 19,000 genes. Technological advances have led to the ability to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genome data in a timely manner, clearly changing the diagnostic paradigm and proving to be cost-effective in many cases (Soden et al. 2014).

Although targeted panels may appear to be a more economical approach to WES/ WGS, this is only the case if the gene relevant to the patient being tested is present on the panel, which is often difficult to know a priori, particularly in patients with nonspecific symptoms such as intellectual disability or seizures. In many cases, serial testing of additional genes and panels quickly surpasses the expense of WES/WGS (Soden et al. 2014). In addition, targeted panels may fail to incorporate newly discovered disease-associated genes.",

For example, new genes associated with both syndromic and nonsyndromic macrocephaly have been identified, further expanding the genetic heterogeneity to more than 165 conditions, including 17 metabolic disorders, associated with macrocephaly (Williams et al. 2008; Keppler-Noreuil et al. 2014; Koh et al. 2014; Marchese et al. 2014; Sugathan et al. 2014; Nevado et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2015). One such gene, KPTN , encoding kaptin, was first reported in January of 2014 in patients with a syndrome typified by macrocephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, and seizures (MRT41; OMIM# 615637) (Baple et al. 2014; Pajusalu et al. 2015). KPTN is not currently offered in any clinical panels for macrocephaly in the United States. Of the clinical laboratories listed in the NextGxDx website, only two of 16 offer KPTN as part of an autism/intellectual disability panel, and only two of 17 include it as part of an epilepsy panel.",

The comparison of such gene lists is difficult for clinicians and the curation is onerous for the clinical laboratory to manage. Clinical WES/WGS removes the guesswork as far as which gene to include, as all genes relevant to the patient ' s phenotype are queried in the analysis process. In the current case, by using clinical WGS in a 9-yr-old Caucasian male admitted in pediatric intensive care unit for status epilepticus, a diagnosis of KPTN -related disease was made. A comparison of the individual clinical signs in patients reported with KPTN -related disease are shown in Table 2.

Key Findings**\nA striking finding is the universal presence of Frontal bossing in all 12 patients (100.0%) within the \"Mixed, Kansas*\" group with the c.394+1G>A /p.M241Q 246Dup genotype. This feature also consistently appears in all six patients from the Amish, Ohio group with the p.S259*/p.M241Q246Dup genotype, and in Patient 11 from Estonia. Hypertelorism is another highly consistent feature, present in all six patients (4-9) from the Amish, Ohio p.S259*/p.M241Q246Dup group. Prominent chin is notable in the Mixed, Kansas* group, affecting a majority of patients (7 out of 12, or 58.3%). Plagiocephaly and Recurrent infections each affect one-third of the Mixed, Kansas* group (4 out of 12 patients, 33.3%).",

The footnote also clarifies that a question mark could represent a normal finding (N) or that the procedure was not performed (N/P) depending on the context. Additionally, abbreviations such as (F) Female, (M) Male, (OFC) occipitofrontal circumference, (SD) standard deviation score, (AS) absence of seizures, and (GTC) generalized tonic-clonic seizures are defined, though not all are directly used in this specific table snippet. The primary references for the patient data are Baple et al., 2014, and Pajusalu et al., 2015.",
