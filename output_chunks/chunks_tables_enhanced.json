Only about 15 affected individuals have been described in the literature, all with primary or secondary macrocephaly.

In total, two KPTN variants were already reported as a loss of function variants. A novel splice site variant in KPTN was detected in two unrelated families of this study.

Using microsatellite-marker analysis followed by whole exome sequencing (WES), the homozygous truncating variant p.(Ser259 ∗ ) in the KPTN gene (NM_007059.4) was discovered in two families of this study (1). In the two other families of this study, the above-mentioned nonsense variant was detected in a compound heterozygous state with an in-frame duplication p.(Met241_246Glndup).

Functional studies of both variants suggested a loss of function effect (LoF) either by the degradation of the mutant transcript via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or by the production of mislocalized and/or non-functional protein products (1). This duplication together with the splice site variant c.394 + 1G > A, and a frameshift variant (2) p.(Ser223fs), was described in two further affected families, respectively (2, 3). An additional recurrent homozygous frameshift variant p.(Ser200Ilefs ∗ ) was reported in two unrelated families (4, 5). All these affected individuals presented with core manifestations, developmental delay, and macrocephaly (4, 5). The KPTN gene encodes for kaptin, which plays a crucial role in the neuromorphogenesis and development of the brain. Kaptin was shown to be expressed in neuronal cells and was found to localize to F-actin-rich structures (1).",

Kaptin was shown to be expressed in neuronal cells and was found to localize to F-actin-rich structures (1). Immunofluorescence analyses in primary neuronal cells demonstrated endogenous and GFP-tagged kaptin to be associated with dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures (1). The loss of kaptin function leads to an impairment of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton, dendritic arborization, and spine formation (1). Furthermore, kaptin has been proven as a negative upstream regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway as a part of the KICSTOR protein complex (6). mTORC1 is an important regulator of cell growth and is dysregulated in different human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy phenotypes. Because of hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, patients with pathogenic variants in KPTN might benefit from mTORC inhibitors (5).",

Motor development was normal with rolling from side to side at the age of 9 months and free ambulation at 18 months of age. Cognitive and speech development were delayed already early. During the 1st year, syllables were uttered, and a few single words were spoken inconsistently by the first birthday. Speech comprehension was better than expressive speech. At the age of 6 years, the boy spoke about 50 words inconsistently in one to twoword sentences. At this age, the patient presented with autistic features such as repetitive movements, poor eye contact, and restlessness. Standardized cognitive testing was not feasible due to severe intellectual impairment.",

In the beginning, the GTCS lasted for 30 s and were accompanied by upward gaze and postictal tiredness. Routine electroencephalography (EEG) revealed the focal sharp waves (left, front-oparietal), rhythmic 6 Hz electrical activity, and signs of focal cerebral dysfunction with theta waves slow activity in the frontal area (Figure 2A). Antiseizure medication (ASM) with levetiracetam (40 mg/kg/day) was implemented. Nevertheless, nightly GTCSs were observed in series (each 30 s, with regaining awareness in between) and episodes during sleeping with lip-smacking. Therefore, the dosage of levetiracetam was increased to 60 mg/kg/day and clobazam was added with 0.11 mg/kg/day.

Physical examination at the age of 9 years showed a height of 128 cm ( -1.4 SD), a weight of 30 kg ( -0.1 SD), and no facial abnormalities. Hearing tests gave normal results. Patient 5 was a 6-year-old boy who also showed moderate intellectual disability, especially with difficulties in expressive language. A hearing problem was excluded in this patient. A genetic investigation confirmed the presence of the homozygous variant c.599 + 1G > A in KPTN in both brothers (Figure 3). Neither of them had seizures.
