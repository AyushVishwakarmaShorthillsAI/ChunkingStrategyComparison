All these affected individuals\n presented with core manifestations, developmental delay, and\n macrocephaly (4, 5),\n\nThe KPTN gene encodes for kaptin, which plays a\n crucial role in the neuromorphogenesis and development of\n the brain. Kaptin was shown to be expressed in neuronal\n cells and was found to localize to F-actin-rich structures\n (1). Immunofluorescence analyses in primary neuronal cells\n demonstrated endogenous and GFP-tagged kaptin to be\n associated with dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures (1). The\n loss of kaptin function leads to an impairment of the neuronal\n actin cytoskeleton, dendritic arborization, and spine formation\n (1). Furthermore, kaptin has been proven as a negative upstream\n regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway as a part of\n the KICSTOR protein complex (6). mTORC1 is an important\n regulator of cell growth and is dysregulated in different human.\n diseases, including cancer and epilepsy phenotypes. Because\n of hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, patients with pathogenic\n variants in KPTN might benefit from mTORC inhibitors (5).\n\nDetailed data on seizures and antiepileptic treatment of\n individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in KPTN have not\n yet been published.
